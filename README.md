###Simon-Game
This is a game of square filled with different colors.
In this you have hear some different sounds come from one of the squares,then you have to click on the same square.
After that you level increases by 1.

This game is created using javascript mainly.
I also used some HTML and CSS for basic structure and designing.
I leared its basic version from the @Anyela Yu course of Web Development.
